### Hi there, I'm Shav 👋 

I am a Software Developer with [AND Digital](https://www.and.digital) who works with MERN stack (Reactjs, Node.js and MongoDB) and curious about Cyber Security, #TechForGood and Data Analytics. I am very passionate about giving back to the community by being a Teaching Assistant with [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/) for [Black Codher Bootcamp](https://blackcodher.com/) and advocating for equal and equitable representation in technology. 🤎 

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on updating my portfolio using Reactjs
        🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL outside of work hours!

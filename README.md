# Buenas, Je suis Shav 👋

Multi award-winning Software Developer at [AND Digital](https://www.and.digital), I’m passionate about technology, diversity, and lifelong learning. As a French and Spanish graduate from the Open University (2024), I balanced full-time work and studies over nine years. After pivoting from Finance to Tech in 2021, I’ve specialised in the MERN stack with experience in Java, SQL, and AI, building responsive web applications and driving innovation.

I’m an active public speaker, delivering talks for organisations like the Ministry of Justice, Coding Black Females, AND Digital, and BCS, and contributing to national conferences such as the Yorkshire Post’s Digital and Data Conference. As a proud UN Women UK CSW68 participant, I’m dedicated to amplifying underrepresented voices in tech.

Community impact is at my core - I mentor for [Leeds Trinity University](https://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/) & [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/), and have volunteered as a Teaching Assistant for [Black Codher Bootcamp](https://blackcodher.com/). I champion tech education for young women, partnering with Ahead Partnerships to introduce pupils to the industry through initiatives like GirlTech.

Featured in 'The Voices in the Shadow' (Volume 4) by [GTA Black Women in Tech](https://theblackwomenintech.com/the-voices-in-the-shadow-4/), a book highlighting 51 influential Black women in UK tech. This publication empowers Black women and girls by showcasing successful career paths in the industry. Have been recognised as “One to Watch” at the Leeds Digital Festival Awards 2023, Rising Star 2025 at the Global Queens Awards, and shortlisted for several industry accolades.

### Hi there, I'm Shav 👋 

I am a Software Developer with [AND Digital](https://www.and.digital) who works in Full Stack Development with MERN stack (Reactjs, Node.js and MongoDB) whilst learning React Native and TypeScript, with a curiousity for Cyber Security and UX/UI. Outside of work, I am very passionate about #WomeninTech therefore I spend my time giving back to the tech community by being a Chapter Lead for North & WY and Mentor with [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/), Teaching Assistant for [Black Codher Bootcamp](https://blackcodher.com/) and advocating for equal and equitable representation in technology. 🤎 

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on updating my portfolio using React & Gatsby
        🌱 I’m currently upskilling on Java, Figma and AWS

#### 💃 When I'm not coding you can find me:

* _Birdwatching from my living room window_ 🐦
* _Catching flights to my next destination_ ✈️
* _Babbling in French, Spanish or Romanian at a language exchange_ 
* _Working on my current knitting or crochet project_ 🧶
* _Dancing the evening away to Romeo Santos_ 💃🏾
* _Chilling with the neighbourhood cats_ 🐈🐈‍⬛
